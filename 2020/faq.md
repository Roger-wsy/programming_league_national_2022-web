The timer starts counting down and the judging system is open for submissions as soon as the competition starts. Rack
your brains to prepare and submit your solutions to the exhilarating challenges! The shorter the time taken to solve the
challenges, the more credits you will get, but bear in mind that there will be 20 minutes penalty time induced for each
rejected submission, so think twice before you hand in your magnum opus. All the best!
