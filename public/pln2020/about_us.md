# About Us

Programming League is an annual competitive programming contest organised by the Faculty of Computer Science and
Information Technology, University of Malaya where teams of 3 compete to solve algorithmic problems.

For the past few years, it had been a university-wide competition. In 2020, we are ramping it up by assembling students
from all universities across Malaysia to compete among the best in the field!

We aim to host the most colossal, eminent and pioneering programming contest of all time and ultimately, uphold
Malaysiaâ€™s programming standards.
